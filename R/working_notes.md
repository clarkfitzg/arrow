## Debugging

Summary:

It seems that the shared pointer, when I look inside it, has the value
`_M_ptr = 0x0000000000000000` inside the C code when calling
`arrow_to_double()`, when it had a different value when it was created with `double_to_arrow`.

```

R -d lldb

b R_arrow_to_double

b R_double_to_arrow

r

library(Rarrow)

x = rnorm(3)

xa = double_to_arrow(x)

# This is at 
# Slot "ref":
# <pointer: 0x7fffffffbe20>
xa
```

Next: compile without any optimization so I can better debug.


```

x2 = arrow_to_double(xa)

(lldb) print array
(std::shared_ptr<arrow::Array> *) $1 = 0x00007fffffffbe20
(lldb) print *array
(std::shared_ptr<arrow::Array>) $2 = {
  std::__shared_ptr<arrow::Array, __gnu_cxx::_Lock_policy> = {
    _M_ptr = 0x0000000000000000
    _M_refcount = {
      _M_pi = 0x0000000002429a90
    }
  }
}
```

This shows that the internal pointer is to memory address 0x0, which seems
suspicious. What was it for the original array?

```

(lldb) print array
(std::shared_ptr<arrow::Array>) $2 = {
  std::__shared_ptr<arrow::Array, __gnu_cxx::_Lock_policy> = {
    _M_ptr = 0x0000000001ccd0c0
    _M_refcount = {
      _M_pi = 0x0000000001ccd0b0
    }
  }
}


```


## Open C++ Questions

Given an array of doubles in C (no null values), what's the simplest way to make an
`arrow::Array` object from them? The `builder.append()` approach as
described in the [C++ docs](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/index.html)
seems more appropriate if we don't know the initial size of the array.

------------------------------------------------------------

Where is the `Int64Array` defined in Arrow as used in the line:

```
std::shared_ptr<Int64Array> int64_array = std::static_pointer_cast<Int64Array>(array);
```

Because I'd like to do the same with an array of doubles.

------------------------------------------------------------

Line 294 of `pandas_to_arrow.cc` calls the conversion:

>   // Traditional visitor conversion for non-object arrays

Is there a reference for this? I looked through the `visitor` files source
and am not sure what's happening.


## First Steps

Following Wes' note on the mailing list.

The first goal is go back and forth between R's `data.frame` and arrow
record batches.

Python currently implements one direction for this in the C++
`arrow_to_pandas.h`:

```
Status ConvertArrayToPandas(
    const std::shared_ptr<Array>& arr, PyObject* py_ref, PyObject** out);

Status ConvertColumnToPandas(
    const std::shared_ptr<Column>& col, PyObject* py_ref, PyObject** out);

Status ConvertTableToPandas(
    const std::shared_ptr<Table>& table, int nthreads, PyObject** out);
```

Following this, the simplest thing to do is convert between Arrow arrays
and
R vectors for a couple numeric types.

Appears that `PushArray` on line 333 in `pandas_to_arrow.h` is doing the
actual work.


## Feather

Scanning through the feather code base, they write S3 methods for the file
containing the feather data to emulate a data.frame on disk. Perfectly
reasonable.


## What I want

- Better interoperability between R and other languages / big data tools
- A file format that supports chunked computations in a more natural way.
  Hopefully this will enhance parallel and out of core computing.
- Efficient columnar storage that preserves metadata
- Learn more C++ / low level details of data storage
